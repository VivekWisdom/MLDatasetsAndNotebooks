This repository will be hosting my notebooks for popular datsets practice.

One dataset can have multiple notebooks so hierarchy will based on dataset name.

# Project Dependencies

- Python 3.6 
- Python libraries like `numpy, pandas, matplotlib`

Create Virtual Environment
  - `virtualenv <directory-name> -p python3.6`
  
Activate Virtual Environment
  - `source <directory-name ref>/bin/activate`
  
# Install Dependencies

Install all dependencies using pip and requirements file after activate your virtual environment.

Note: Complete all steps before this.

`pip install -r requirement.txt`
